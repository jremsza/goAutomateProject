# goAutomateProject
This project explores the potenital for automating Go programs by revisiting Testing Stats with Go project.

# Automated Code Generation
The third party Jennifer package was used to generate a unit test for a LinearRegresion function seen in the `Testing Stats with Go` program. The code to build the unit test is located in the `autoGen` directory and is contained in the `main.go` file. The `linReg_test.go file`, also located in `autoGen` is the output of the autogenerated unit test code.

### Summary to Management

The code output creates a unit test that attempts to test that the CalculateLinearRegression function is working correctly. It does this by checking that the function returns the expected results for a set of predefined test cases. The process of using an autogenerator to build Go code has a steep learning curve and is not intuitive. The Github repo `https://github.com/dave/jennifer` was helpful with the coding task but the time spent coding a code generator would have been better spent coding the actual unit test. If the unit test needed is deemed to be used very frequently then the autogenerator may be useful, but not enough to replace an engineer. 

# AI Assisted Programming

Inside the `copilot` directory is where you will find the AI assisted code that was generated from the `Testing Stats with Go` main project file and is title `statsRegen.go`. The code was taken from the stats project repository and fed into Github Copilot. The AI assistant was asked to improve upon the current code. The assistant gave a responce in text form and then gave code output with the iprovments. The go file is the code with AI suggested improvements and text file that contains the chat history from the assistant. The suggestions for improvment included error handling, code duplication, renaming variables and adding extra code comments for clearity. The https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview webpage was useful in this coding appraoch. The tips found there were useful in navigating the AI assistant to the questions that were more targeted to the goal.

### Summary to Managment

This appraoch proved plausable for the targeted goals. The AI assistant was prompt, concise, and added value to the program. However, engineers are still necessary to build the code and oversee program execution. The AI assistant will no doubt add value with error reduction and productivity for the engineers.

# AI Generated Code

ChatGPT 3.5 was used for the production of the program found in `gptStats.go`. A text file is also contained in the same directory with a chat history of the program build. The AI chatbot was able to build a program from the provided prompt, although it was not a working program. The AI chatbot was asked initally to build a Go program that performs linear regression on the Anscombe Quartet dataset and the program should yield at minimum estimated linear regression coefficients. Initially the program generated a generic script that was then instructed to fill in with specfic details. Upon more questions, the chatbot produced a full program and suggested the use of gonum/mat package for the task. This package was different then the original package used for the project which was montanaflynn/stats.

### Summary to Managment

The final go program is complete but full of erros and will not complie. This option may be plauseable with more targeted prompts for short scripts but can not replace an engineer outright. Much like the AI-assitant, the chatbot can be a good compainion to the engineer. However, the time spent asking questions for misguided program production may be better spent just writting the program by a human. 

# Conclusion

The recomendation is to use Github Copilot as an AI assited pair programmer. None of these technologies are enough in their current form to outright remove the human from the production of software. However, if the AI assisted approach is proving to be an increase of engineer productivity, a reduction in head count may be achievable.
